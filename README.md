# 🚀 REM Waste – Lead Scoring & Notification Bot (n8n Workflow)

## 📌 Overview

With utmost appreciation for the opportunity to take part in REM Waste's technical challenge, I present this fully functional workflow built using **free-tier tools**. It automates the intake, qualification, and follow-up of marketing leads based on interest and budget — storing results in Google Sheets and notifying the team via Slack when a high-potential opportunity arises. This solution aligns with the specifications outlined in your brief and is designed with scalability, clarity, and operational efficiency in mind.

## 🧠 Lead Scoring Logic

### 🔎 Logic Summary:

The scoring mechanism is based on both budget size and expressed interest level.

| Budget (£) | Interest Level | Score |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----- |
| > 5000     | High           | HOT   |
| 1000–5000  | High or Medium | WARM  |
| Else       | Any            | COLD  |

### 💻 JavaScript Code Snippet

```javascript
let score = "Cold";
if (budget > 5000 && interestLevel === "High") {
  score = "Hot";
} else if (
  (budget >= 1000 && budget <= 5000 && (interestLevel === "High" || interestLevel === "Medium")) ||
  (budget > 5000 && interestLevel === "Medium")
) {
  score = "Warm";
}
```

This logic is processed dynamically inside an `n8n Code` node after field mapping and value normalization.

## 🔄 Workflow Description (n8n)

> 📸 *Screenshot of Workflow:* ![n8n Workflow Overview](./assets/n8n_workflow_screenshot.png)

The workflow consists of interconnected nodes covering intake, validation, scoring, enrichment, storage, and notifications.

### 📥 Input Trigger

* Initiated by `POST` requests via form or Postman.
* Required fields: `full_name`, `email`, `phone`, `company_size`, `budget`, `interest_level`.

### ✅ Validation & Scoring

* `If Node`: Validates field presence.
* `Email Regex`: Ensures correct email structure.
* `Code Node`: Maps values and determines lead score.

### 📝 Data Storage

* `Google Sheets`: Appends all enriched lead data + timestamp.

### 🚨 Slack Notifications

* `Slack Node`: Delivers full lead info for HOT leads.
* Includes Gemini-generated insights (summary, value, action items).
* For **non-HOT leads (Warm or Cold)**, the message is sent to a **separate Slack channel** dedicated to general lead tracking and lower-priority nurturing. This segmentation helps the sales team focus attention where it matters most while still keeping track of all incoming opportunities.

* Includes Gemini-generated insights (summary, value, action items).

## 🤖 Gemini AI Integration

> 📸 *Marketing Pitch Example:* ![Hot Lead Pitch Email](./assets/hot_lead_pitch_example.png)

| Use Case                  | Output                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Internal Summary**   | Sales-ready headline + analysis + call-to-actions for team               |
| **2. Personalized Pitch** | Custom-tailored email pitch per lead based on size, interest, and budget |

**Why this matters:**

In addition to internal summaries, the workflow generates a dedicated marketing pitch tailored to each **HOT lead**. This pitch includes a concise, persuasive message that references the lead’s company size, declared interest, and allocated budget — all synthesized using Gemini AI. The output emphasizes REM Waste’s value proposition, showcases relevant success stories, and ends with a strong call to action (e.g., schedule a sustainability consultation or request a waste audit).

Such personalization ensures every high-potential lead receives a message that is timely, insightful, and aligned with their business context — helping REM Waste convert interest into tangible engagement.

* Converts form data into strategic actions.
* Equips the sales team with intelligent context for each hot lead.
